### Overview
 - In high school Chemistry, there are several basic (yet critical) skills that students must master.  These include taking quality measurements, performing metric conversions, dealing with significant figures/scientific notation, solving problems using dimensional analysis and writing chemical formulas.
 - Each of these skills gets better with practice, but how much practice a student needs varies from person to person.  Providing each student with just the right amount of practice AND timely feedback is challenging.
 - This project combines the Naming and SigFigs web apps, but it adds login and database functionality as well as scored quizzes.   
 - Quizzes consist of 10 - 20 randomly generated, skill-specific questions.  User information and quiz results are stored in the database, which allows students and teachers to track progress.
 - Students login to the app to complete tutorials, practice problems and scored quizzes.  
 - Teachers login to see a list of their students, assign these students to different classes or view quiz results for their students.  Teachers can view scores for all of their students or for a subset of their roster.  Average results for each quiz can be viewed for a selection of students or the entire roster.
 - This project utilizes a modular design, making it easy to add additional skills and expand the reach of the program.
 
### Features
 - Interactive tutorials (dynaminc notes, short video clips and guided practice problems) help introduce students to the new skills.
 - "Infinite practice" options provide immediate feedback to help students master the new skills.
 - Randomly generated quizzes allow students and teaches to assess progress.
 - Database functionality preserves user information (name, e-mail, best quiz scores, etc.).
 - Hashing preserves password security.
